## eXtensible Markup Language

ShockScript incorporates eXtensible Markup Language (XML) expressions suitable for implementing GUIs, and also includes capabilities for users interested on XML data processing.

For the Whack Engine, XML expressions create WhackDS nodes by default.

## Events

ShockScript incorporates a basic event model and allows easily declaring event types and documenting them. Implementations may extend the event model for working with a Document Object Model.

## ShockDoc

ShockScript supports documentation comments allowing for Markdown notation, special tags such as `@throws` and media inclusion.
