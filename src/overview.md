## E4X

ShockScript is mixed with the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), based on the legacy ECMAScript for XML (E4X) extension. It is, in addition, suitable for implementing reactive UI components.

For the Whack Engine, E4X literals create Whack DS nodes by default.

## Events

ShockScript incorporates a basic event model and allows easily declaring event types and documenting them. Implementations may extend the event model for working with a Document Object Model.

## ShockDoc comments

ShockScript supports documentation comments allowing for Markdown notation, special tags such as `@throws` and media inclusion.

## Abbreviation

ShockScript is abbreviated as SX and uses the conventional file extension ".sx".
